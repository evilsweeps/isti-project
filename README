For the test program, we would like you to try the following. This second phase of this test may be confusing,
so please do not hesitate to ask any questions, and if need be I can modify this test to make it a more straight forward task.

Using the libmseed package at http://www.iris.edu/dms/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/,
please write code to read in the attached data file (called an mseed, or miniseed file) containing compressed integer data. 
(This is an actual seismic event.) The resulting input should be an array of integers, with an associated start time and sample rate. 
(should be 40 samples per second, if I remember correctly)

Then using the FFT3 library at http://www.fftw.org/, please return the FFT of this signal in frequency vs amplitude format. 
Again email/call me if you have any questions (my cell is 518-527-6219).

Your code should be able to open and read the file, calculate the FFT, and then print the output to a file.
